# JavaScript Calculator

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com) is a website that simulates a calculator. I made this for a freeCodeCamp challenge (Build a JavaScript Calculator).

## Outline

The outline of the challenge was:

 - The user can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

 - UI can clear the input field with a clear button.

 - The user can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
